In my thesis I plan to investigate time-resolved structural dynamics and charge ordering phenomena by the means of electron scattering.
Many aspects of cooperative phenomena in solid state physics are not well understood; experiments with high temporal resolution play a key role in unveiling microscopic mechanisms.
Ultrafast electron diffraction and ultrafast electron diffuse scattering provide the means access structural and phonon information, as explained in the second part of this document.
I will start my research by studying the \ac{CDW} phase of the \ac{TMD} \ts\space whose ground state is yet to be understood.
Entangling the contribution of lattice and electronic degrees of freedom in the low temperature phase of \ts\space could give new exciting insights to other phenomena observed in this material, such as superconductivity.

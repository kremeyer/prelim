\ts is a material in the group of \acp{TMD}.
All \ac{TMD} appear in the general form MX\textsubscript{2} with M being a layer of transition-metal atoms such as molybdenum, tungsten or titanium which are sitting between two layers of species X from the group of chalcogens like sulfur or selenium.
This covalently bonded structure is called a \ac{TMD} monolayer.
\Ac{TMD} bulk material is made up of many monolayers stacked monolayers, bonded by van-der-Waals interaction.

The research part of my studies will focus on the \ac{TMD} \ts.
Its crystal structure is depicted in \ref{fig:crystal}\,a. The unit cell contains one titanium atom and two selenium atoms.

a = 3.541
c = 6.001
